# Requirements

## Introduction
A fully featured calculator which involves functions like basic operations, financial operations and some other operations. The project includes logarithms, factorials, exponentials, power functions, finding simple and compound interests, total amount.  
The calculator program is written in C language with proper testing cases and makefile.

## Research
The basic calculator doesn't involve any  log operations or any operations related to finding interests. It is easy to apply  the values in the system to find the interest amounts rather than remembering and applying it in formula. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.

## Cost and Features
As far as the project is well built and all the requirements met the cost can be varied according to the market.
### Features

 - *Addition* : The addition (sum function) is used by choosing the "+" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a+b.
 - *Subtraction* : The subtraction (diff function) is used by choosing the "-" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a-b.
 - *Multiplication* : The multiplication (mul function) is used by choosing the "*" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a*b.
 - *Division* : The division (div function) is used by choosing the "/" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a/b.
 - *Simple Interest* : The simple interest (simple_interest function) is found by choosing "1". The function results in (p*t*r)/100. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest, t is number of time periods elapsed.
 - *Compound Interest* : The compound interest (compound_interest function) is found by choosing "2". The function results in p*(1+(r/100))^t. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest and t is number of time period.
 - *Total Amount* : The amount (total_amount function) is found by choosing "3". The function results in P+I. I is interest and P is principle
 - *Natural Exponential* :  The natural exponential (e raised to the x) is used by choosing "1" which results e^x or exp(). The result is e (2.71828...) raised to x. 
 - *Logarithm* : The logarithm (LOG) is used by choosing "2" which results LOG() where base is 10.
 - *Factorial* : The Factorial function is used by choosing "3" which results x!=x*(x-1)...2*1.
 - *Raise to the Power* : The raise to the power (y_raised_to_x function) is used by choosing "4" which results y^x.
 
# Defining the system

The system mainly involves three operation modes. They are basic, financial and other operation modes. All the operation modes are subdivided into operations where user can choose the operation he wants and can perform accordingly. The result will be displayed at the end.

# 4 W's and 1 H
### WHO 
 The project can be used almost by all. All the financial related employees and students can use the program to find out the answer they need. At the end,  user satisfaction is the goal  of the project.
### WHAT
Calculations related to basic math and finance can be calculated quickly. All the basics functionalities are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.

### WHEN
The project can be used at the time of solving the calculations 
and get the results for basic and finance related problems. The result will be obtained quickly.

### WHERE
In all the domains it can be used. As the project is portable and user-friendly, it can be easily implemented on the mobile systems and finance companies. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.

### HOW
System design is a solution for “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
